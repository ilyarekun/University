# Team project 

The semester project will consist of 5 member teams that you choose yourself. Unfilled teams will be merged or supplemented additionally without the possibility of change.
Individual teams will choose from published topics on which they will work throughout the semester. Individual topics will be assigned a mentor who will communicate and consult on the issues of the given topic.


## Term of team project
- Understand the given issue, create an analysis of the project at hand, and propose a workflow for the project (subsequently consulting with your mentors).
- Develop a functional solution for the chosen topic in the form of a Proof of Concept (PoC) or a DEMO application.
- Establish regular code review committees (this helps track who worked on what) using only the repository/GitLab provided to you.
- It's also necessary to create a summary article (using a 2-column template) by the set deadline, describing and documenting your solution from a more technical and scientific perspective.
- Prepare a final presentation that you will then deliver at the closing presentation.


## Final presentation
At the final project presentation, individual teams show their solutions in front of other teams and mentors. 
At the presentation, you must also point out who was involved in which part of the project solution.

**Participation in the final presentations is mandatory.**

| 3              | Explainable AI + saliency mapping                                                                            | The goal of the project is to investigate the effect of changing the brightness of images belonging to specific classes in the dataset on the accuracy of the model and the saliency of the map. The experiment involves gradually adjusting the brightness of one class in a three-class dataset upwards, the second class downwards, and leaving the third class in its original state. Subsequently, with the help of saliency mapping and accuracy tracking, it is determined how the overall brightness of the examples of the class affects the model's decision making when classifying the examples. The hypothesis is that at some point the model will start making decisions based on the overall brightness of the images rather than other patterns. I will explain the specific testing methods in more detail during the consultation, and we can possibly adapt them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Bc.

| 4              | Visualization of the effect of convolutional layers                                                          | In deep neural networks, the first convolutional part is responsible for modifying the feature space in order to simplify the classification. In this project, you will create an application that will project the feature space and outputs from convolutional layers onto a two-dimensional plane and thus be able to visualize the effect of individual convolutional layers. You will then train several networks and test the functionality of the application. You can base your solution on existing solutions, each team member is expected to prepare at least one sample example (neural network) on benchmark data. Work on the project can be divided into subtasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Ing.

Based on research, each student chooses one model and then performs fine-tuning. The dataset will be determined at the consultation. The models will then be evaluated on the basis of the chosen metrics, which we will also determine during the consultation. Each student submits graphs for training and validation error in training, evaluation of models based on metrics, code. All this data is uploaded by each student to a common git.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Bc.

| 8              | Comparison of different types of neural networks for predicting the suitability of the produced agglomerate. | The goal of the assignment is to work with data and implement a neural network for the purpose of predicting A/N quantities that determine the quality of seeding or chemical analysis in the production of pig iron.   The first part of the assignment represents parsing and working with data that describe operating quantities during production where:  The first dataset represents data from seeding - granularity, which needs to be parsed back to the measured values of the spicing belt.    The second dataset represents the data from the chemical analysis, which needs to be parsed back to the measured values of the spicing belt.    The output of the first part is the creation of two datasets of time series (timeseries), the first x columns of the dataset represent the measured values of the sintering belt and the last column (attribute) represents the suitability of the produced agglomerate (seeding or chemical composition).    In the second part of the assignment, students choose a neural network model based on research that will predict A/N values. A/N values represent the suitability of seeding or chemical composition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Ing.
